             Hi! This is a webapp developed by me, Ashwathi, with what I've learned from the IMAD course, and also after surfing the web a little for more information and ideas. I made my first webapp as a part of my college project. It used HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL mainly. I simply typed the code in notepad++ and uploaded it using an FTP client. That was before the course. This webapp, on the other hand, is developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL mainly. After this course, I have learned many more things about how to efficiently make a webapp, most of which information I have used in creating this website.
