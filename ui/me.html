            <h3>About the developer</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Ashwathi. I am good at communicating with people. I am always excited to learn new things and am ready to work harder to do so. I have passed my B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a first class (honours). I have attended seminars on Communication Networks and workshops on Embedded systems. I took up this course to develop my skills and to broaden my knowledge base, which I feel has been fulfilled.
